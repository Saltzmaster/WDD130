      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>If you were going to introduce the planet to someone who's never been here before how would you do it? How would you describe each country without bias and incorrect information? Well that's what I'm here to do but for my fictional world of ____ from the book I'm writing. The front page will be an interactive map of the world! Then each country will have their own page designed from the perspective of a delegation from their own country making it as fair and accurate as possible. There will also be a smaller map on each individual page showing their countries boarders. This'll make it as interesting as possible while being easy to understand. Doesn't this make you curious to just see the map?</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>It'll be targeted towards teens to young adults. Mostly the nerdy kids who've read a lot and who read fictional books.</p>  <!-- change this -->

            This kingdom is the oldest but is considered the melting pot and has the widest variety of people. Here you can find some of the weakest citizens of the world but it’d be a mistake to think this Kingdom weak as it’s guarded by some of the strongest people in the world. Most people start here as it’s one of the safest for people new on the path of power, although there is a decent amount of competition for the training areas.

            Here at this kingdom learning is considered the rule of the world. Scholors from around the world gather here to learn about The Nothing and about science. If you want to learn or help in the pursuit of knowledge then this is the kingdom for you. There are very little here for those who pursue power so it’s not a common starting point. Currently the home of the number one strongest person in the world.
