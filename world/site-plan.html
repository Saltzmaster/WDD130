      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>If you were going to introduce the planet to someone who's never been here before how would you do it? How would you describe each country without bias and incorrect information? Well that's what I'm here to do but for my fictional world of ____ from the book I'm writing. The front page will be an interactive map of the world! Then each country will have their own page designed from the perspective of a delegation from their own country making it as fair and accurate as possible. There will also be a smaller map on each individual page showing their countries boarders. This'll make it as interesting as possible while being easy to understand. Doesn't this make you curious to just see the map?</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>It'll be targeted towards teens to young adults. Mostly the nerdy kids who've read a lot and who read fictional books.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        <p>
            This kingdom is the oldest but is considered the melting pot and has the widest variety of people. Here you can find some of the weakest fighters in the world, but it would be a mistake to think this Kingdom weak as it is guarded by some of the strongest people in the world. Most people start here as it is one of the safest for people new on the path of power, although there is a decent amount of competition for the training areas.
        </p>
      </div>

            </span>
        </h3>
        <p>
            Here in this kingdom learning is considered the rule of the world. Scholars from around the world gather here to learn about The Nothing and about science. If you want to learn or help in the pursuit of knowledge, then this is the kingdom for you. There are very few here for those who pursue power, so it is not a common starting point. Currently the home of the number one strongest person in the world.
        </p>
      </div>

        <h3>

        </h3>
        <p>
            Due to sharing the continent with kingdom 4 they are always at war with them trying to take sole ownership of the mineral rich land. They export chloramine (aka floatstone), and their society is filled with war veterans and soldiers from the constant fighting between the two countries. Common starting point because of the quick way to grow stronger. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>
            Kingdom 4

                grid_goldenratio
            </span>
        </h3>
        <p>
            Caused by sharing the continent with kingdom 3 they are in a constant state of war attempting to wrestle control of the wealth inspiring land. The main export is aquifer (aka solid water) and is also filled with warriors who have high strength and experience from ceaseless warring. Often a good starting point due to the high amount of fighting.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>
            Kingdom 5

                memory
            </span>
        </h3>
        <p>
            Kingdom 5 is the trade center of the world, mostly due to its central location and massive ports. Most of the wealth of the world flows through here and as such this kingdom has the highest number of mercenaries. While not a particularly good starting point everyone ends up passing through here at some point or another.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>

            </span>
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Orhil Captial and a very elitist kingdom this is the smallest kingdom. If you are an orhil then this is the single greatest starting point. The other races are treated as lesser beings and often have fewer rights here. It is a general rule for Aelv and Kar to avoid country 6. Hidden in a corner of the world it does not have any significance.
        </p>
      </div>

        </h3>
        <p>
            Nicknames the kingdom of the dead, this kingdom is particularly avoided by all living creatures. Consisting of dark sorcerers, this kingdom has very few living citizens with all the labor being done by the dead. These sorcerers who rise and control the dead are ostracized by every other kingdom and people. The only reason to come here is to learn these dark abilities.  
        </p>

        </h3>
        <p>
            Bordering the rift to The Nothing this kingdom consists only of battle tested warriors. While it is widely known to have the highest death rates those who manage to survive are the strongest of the strong. Definitely the hardest starting point but if you can persevere then you will be set onto the path to success. The rift has a steady flow of creatures coming into the world with malicious intent. Attacks can happen at any time with varying frequencies.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>

        </h3>
        <p>
            At this kingdom magic is considered to be evil and untrustworthy. They practice lots of other techniques but refuse the aid of magic in both utility and combat. It is illegal to use magic within the borders of the kingdom and often results in conflicts with the neighboring kingdoms. The fact that they have yet to be wiped out is a testament to their strength. A decent starting point for those with no desire to use magic.

      <p>A Rune for each race and then the meaning on their page </p>
      <h3>The Aelv</h3>
      <p>   
        The best way to describe the Aelv is to say they are a humanoid mix between a frog and a tyrannosaurus rex. They have four arms, and their skin is like that of a frogs. They have thick necks and large heads shaped like a dinosaurs. Their legs are formed much like a humans and they actually do not have a tail. Each hand and foot only have four fingers each with a small claw protruding from the tips but otherwise very similar to that of a humans. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The Aelv have a unique system that connects them to the Nothing. They tattoo their bodies with the runes needed to connect them to the Nothing. This is definitely the fastest way to cast spells but the drawbacks are the pain and preparation needed beforehand as well as the inflexibility of spells they can cast, making adaptation in battle nearly impossible. 
      </p>

        <img src="img/Aelv.jpg" alt="image for page">
        <img src="img/Aelv_magic.png" alt="image for page">

      </ul>
      <h3>The Kar</h3>
      <p>
        Consider what an alligator would look like as a human, that would be a Kar. The Kar have thick leather-like skin and have slight webbing under their arms and legs as well as in between their fingers and toes and there are sharp claws protruding from each as well. Their long thick tails and long almost snout like noses are distinguishing features. Their teeth are sharp and serrated and they have no visible ears, only small hearing holes like most reptiles. The rest of their build is similar to that of any human including five fingers and toes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Kar connects to the Nothing with jewelry although they mostly use rings and sometimes bracelets. Each is inscribed with runes and symbols for a single spell. This is both fast and comfortable, the ability to change rings quickly has a very high battle flexibility and convenience. The drawbacks are the price and accessibility. The material needed to craft the rings is rare and expensive and if a mage is caught without their tools then they are often defenseless.  
      </p>
      <p>Images for the Page 3</p>
        <img src="img/Kar.jpg" alt="image for page3">
        <img src="img/Kar_magic.png" alt="image for page3">

      </ul>
      <h3>The Orhil</h3>
      <p>
        The Orhil are definitely the apex. They are considered the most beautiful race and their agility and connection to the Nothing are top notch. They look like a human snake hybrid. They two arms and to legs but they have scales instead of skin and their neck is fanned while their head is triangle shaped. They have a long tail and golden eyes. Their appendages all work like that of a human as well as the added functions a snake would have. Their lean muscles and slick but tough skin combined with their ability to perfectly grasp tools and weapons allows them to reign supreme on this world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to their high connection to the Nothing the Orhil do not need anything special to help them cast spells. Instead they can draw them in the air. The only limits from them are skill and imagination. It’s often thought that their spellcasting is the slowest but widely agreed one that it’s the strongest and most flexible of the mage arts. The strongest mages have been known to cast spells almost instantly with the smallest hand and finger movements possible sense the size of the runes is irrelevant to the power of the spell.
