                    This kingdom is the oldest but is considered the melting pot and has the widest variety of people. Here you can find some of the weakest fighters in the world, but it would be a mistake to think this Kingdom weak as it is guarded by some of the strongest people in the world. Most people start here as it is one of the safest for people new on the path of power, although there is a decent amount of competition for the training areas.

                    Here in this kingdom learning is considered the rule of the world. Scholars from around the world gather here to learn about The Nothing and about science. If you want to learn or help in the pursuit of knowledge, then this is the kingdom for you. There are very few here for those who pursue power, so it is not a common starting point. Currently the home of the number one strongest person in the world.

                    Due to sharing the continent with kingdom 4 they are always at war with them trying to take sole ownership of the mineral rich land. They export chloramine (aka floatstone), and their society is filled with war veterans and soldiers from the constant fighting between the two countries. Common starting point because of the quick way to grow stronger.

                    Caused by sharing the continent with kingdom 3 they are in a constant state of war attempting to wrestle control of the wealth inspiring land. The main export is aquifer (aka solid water) and is also filled with warriors who have high strength and experience from ceaseless warring. Often a good starting point due to the high amount of fighting.

                    Kingdom 5 is the trade center of the world, mostly due to its central location and massive ports. Most of the wealth of the world flows through here and as such this kingdom has the highest number of mercenaries. While not a particularly good starting point everyone ends up passing through here at some point or another.

                    The Orhil Captial and a very elitist kingdom this is the smallest kingdom. If you are an orhil then this is the single greatest starting point. The other races are treated as lesser beings and often have fewer rights here. It is a general rule for Aelv and Kar to avoid country 6. Hidden in a corner of the world it does not have any significance.

                    Nicknames the kingdom of the dead, this kingdom is particularly avoided by all living creatures. Consisting of dark sorcerers, this kingdom has very few living citizens with all the labor being done by the dead. These sorcerers who rise and control the dead are ostracized by every other kingdom and people. The only reason to come here is to learn these dark abilities.

                    Bordering the rift to The Nothing this kingdom consists only of battle tested warriors. While it is widely known to have the highest death rates those who manage to survive are the strongest of the strong. Definitely the hardest starting point but if you can persevere then you will be set onto the path to success. The rift has a steady flow of creatures coming into the world with malicious intent. Attacks can happen at any time with varying frequencies.

                    At this kingdom magic is considered to be evil and untrustworthy. They practice lots of other techniques but refuse the aid of magic in both utility and combat. It is illegal to use magic within the borders of the kingdom and often results in conflicts with the neighboring kingdoms. The fact that they have yet to be wiped out is a testament to their strength. A decent starting point for those with no desire to use magic.
